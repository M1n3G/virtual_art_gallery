## Using it with [local images]

The local api is accessible using this URI params in the address bar: ```?api=local``` (it's possible to load automatically this API by changing the default API in the [api.js](api/api.js) file). You can change the displayed images in the folder [images](images), you will need to rebuild the project (or relauch the dev server) to apply the modifications.
